    <h1>Lily's Dress Up Studio — Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="updated">Effective date: February 26, 2026</p>

    <p>Lily's Dress Up Studio ("the App") is a children's dress-up game for iPad, developed by Robert Berrisford. We take children's privacy very seriously. This policy explains how the App handles data.</p>

    <h2>We Do Not Collect Data</h2>
    <p>The App does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information from its users. It contains no analytics, no advertising, no tracking, and no third-party SDKs. The App makes no network requests and operates entirely offline.</p>

    <h2>What Is Stored on the Device</h2>
    <p>The App saves character designs (outfit choices and thumbnail images) that the user creates. This data is stored locally on the device only and is never sent anywhere. No personal information is included in this data.</p>

    <h2>Photo Library</h2>
    <p>The App may request permission to save an image to the device's Photo Library when the user chooses to export a character design. This action is protected behind a parent gate. No photos are read from or accessed in the Photo Library.</p>

    <h2>No Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App uses no third-party libraries, SDKs, or services of any kind. It is built entirely with Apple's native frameworks.</p>

    <h2>No Accounts or In-App Purchases</h2>
    <p>The App does not require or support user accounts, login, or in-app purchases.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy (COPPA & GDPR)</h2>
    <p>The App is designed for children and is listed in the Kids category on the App Store. It complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) provisions for children. Since no data is collected, no parental consent for data collection is required.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>If we update this policy, the revised version will be posted at this URL with a new effective date.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about this privacy policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:rob@affiliate.ai">rob@affiliate.ai</a>.</p>
